1)point(x,y),polygon[]
each function call prev function--return type boolen(t or f)
2) 1)online()--there are two point a,b.the p point lise between(a,b) are polygon
   2)direction()--point p lise on the edge of polygon or not 
   3)intersect()-- intersect also retuen type of boolean
         its true if our point intersects with the point of polygon that
is line drawn from thepoint intersect if it is intersect with another point of polygon
   4)insise()-- point is inside or not
     n<3(polygon always have min 3 point)(T or F)
   --take extream point right which has the max value arbitary large number
     and point extream will also be used in finding out return value of intersect() function.
    loop use do while loop 
         next = (i + 1) % poly_limit; 
         so that i get one point i an next point  after i of the polygon
       if intersect() 4 point(polygon[i], polygon[next], p, extreme) test true
        if direction(polygon[i], p, polygon[next]) == 0) 
		return  onLine(polygon[i], p, 
                                     polygon[next]);     
     increase count parameter count++.close do while loop, i become next.
              unless while(i!=0).count is odd number point lies inside.
